3. STUDENTS
Manage a list of students. Each student has an id (integer, unique), a name (string) and a group (positive
integer). Provide the user the following features:
1. Add a new student to the list. Student data is read from the console.
2. Show the list of students on the console.
3. Filter the list so that students in a given group (read from the console) are deleted from the list.
4. Undo the last operation that modified program data. This step can be repeated.
